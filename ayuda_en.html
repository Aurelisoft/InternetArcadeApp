<h2>Internet Arcade APP Help</h2>
<p>To play the games available on the Internet Arcade APP, you must first explore the folder corresponding to the desired platform.</p>
<p>Within each folder you will find a list of games corresponding to the platform or console.</p>
<p>Select the desired game; the buttons are already pre-configured.</p>
<p>Before playing, the desired game will be downloaded. In some cases, it may take a long time to load due to the download speed available on the Internet Archive website.</p>
<p>It is recommended to adjust the position of the movement and action buttons. Initially, the button to switch to adjustment mode will change color, indicating that the position has not been saved.</p>
<p>To play Arcade mode, you must first simulate inserting coins into the machine using the button called “Coin”, then you can press the “Start” button to start the game.</p>
<p>You can select the type of movement you want: with direction buttons or with a single joystick-type button.</p>
<p>Try playing vertically or horizontally, depending on your preference.</p>
<p>Activate automatic fire mode by repeatedly pressing the action button. After a few seconds, you can hold it down.</p>
<p>The list of games will increase if the app is well received.</p>
